# Test Examples

These are some example files that are are used in e2e tests. In these tests we
want to assume that our project already contains the files in the
`preexisting/` folder. Then, as a result of a PR or push, we add some new
files, delete some of the preexisiting files, or modify them. If we add any
new gotos, warnings should be triggered.
